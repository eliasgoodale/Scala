# Scala Overview


Scala is an object oriented/functional programming language similiar to Java. 

It is class-based, classes are extendable by subclassing and mixin based composition. 

Scala is functional in that every function is a value and every value is an object, therefore every function is an object.

It has lightweight syntax for anonymous functions, support for Higher Order functions, allows function nesting, and supports currying. 

Scala is statically typed but more lenient on requirements to specify a type or repeat its declaration

Scala runs on the JVM. It is compiled into Java Byte Code by the scala compiler accessed using the 'scala' command.

Scala can execute java code and enables you to use all the classes from the Java SDK, your own custom classes, and open source projects.
